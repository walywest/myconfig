# About this repo:
This is my basic personal configuration files backup for a reproducible environment, somebody might find this helpful to get started with his own.
# Normal config files:
Just regular config files
ps: for the moment nvim is the only config i felt the need to add here
## Neovim:
Much inspired from @theprimegen, plus my prefered window/tabs/ terminal managment plugins, yes i don't use a multiplexer (YET!),
Feel free to tweek it for your own preferences. - use telescope <leader>ps then type "REMAP" and "remap" and "set(" to find the relative keys for each functionality.
# Configuration.nix:
It should start as a very basic configuration.nix file, im not using the home-manager stuff just yet, i want to first only use configuration.nix to learn more about the nixOS/nix language, and the nix ecosystem.
