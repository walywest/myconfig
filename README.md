# About this repo:
This is my basic personal configuration files backup for a reproducible environment, somebody might find this helpful to get started with his own.
## Neovim:
Much inspired from the one and only [theprimegen](https://github.com/theprimeagen), plus my personal preferences, plugins and configurations.
# nixos:
Its quite self-explanatory as i tried to use modular structure.
## Flakes:
Currently its this simple , i dont know about all flakes semantics but these are the reasons im using flakes:
- Declarative version pinning of the nixpkgs inputs
- Cherry-picking different inputs for different packages (very handy in case "unstable" breaks something)
## Useful docs:
[NixManual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/) - [NixWiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Main_Page)
