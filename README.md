# About this repository
This is my personal backup some of my linux configuration files.
# Normal config files:
ps: for the moment nvim is the only config i felt the need to add here
## Neovim:
Much inspired from @theprimegen, plus my prefered window/tabs/ terminal managment plugins, yes i don't use a multiplexer (YET!),
Feel free to tweek it for your own preferences.
# Configuration.nix:
[[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/]]
It should start as a very basic configuration.nix file, im not using the home-manager stuff just yet, i want to first gradually learn about the nixOS/nix language, and the nix ecosystem.
